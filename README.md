# Beans and a Dream
- Staring into your pantry, all you've got is one can of beans, a half cup of rice, and a dream. What can you make? 
- Beans and a Dream aims to be a scalable, ingredient quantity-based recipe search system built with MongoDB Atlas Search and PySpark. Indexes 500k+ recipe documents to search against the exact ingredient amounts you have. A WIP, pending system analyses/benchmarking.
