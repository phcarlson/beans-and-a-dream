# beans-and-a-dream
Staring into your pantry, all you've got is one can of beans, a half cup of rice, and a dream. What can you make? A scalable, ingredient quantity-based recipe search system built with MongoDB Atlas Search and PySpark. Indexes 500k+ recipe documents to search against the exact ingredient amounts you have. A WIP, pending system analyses/benchmarking.
