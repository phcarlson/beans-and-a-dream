# 1) Testing, then plotting query length vs response time to see how the system handles simple to complex queries

# 2) Testing, then plotting query length vs response time to see how much latency query expansion adds

# 3) Query response times, over time, with and without caching

# 4) Bar charts to compare different query types (exact matching, range search, ingredients requiring fuzzy matches)
